## Udacity Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree - Project #3

Project prompt:: 

> Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

> You have been called on to demonstrate your newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:

> 1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
> 2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
> 3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
> 4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
> 
> There are `@TODO` comments throughout the project. We recommend tackling the sections in order. Start by reading the READMEs in:
> 
> 1. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)
> 2. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
